State-of-the-art CNNs in Keras
1. more training time, less test time
2. 

VGG16 and VGG19: Convolution ﬁlters of only 3×3
1. painfully slow to train
2. network weights themselves are quite larger

ResNet: the use of residual modules.

Inception V3: The Inception module acts as a “multi-level feature extractor” by computing 1 × 1, 3 × 3, and 5 × 5 convolutions within the same module of the network.

Xception: SqueezeNet
